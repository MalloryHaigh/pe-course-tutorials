# Hands-On Platform Engineering Labs
Ever wanted to give Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) a try, but not sure where to start?

This repository contains **two** different IDPs that you can setup yourself and take for a test drive as part of the [Platform Engineering Fundamentals](https://platformengineering.org/fundamentals) course via pre-built [Coder](https://coder.com) templates provided by the [PE.org](https://platformengineering.org) education team.

### Demo 1: CNOE Open Source IDP Framework - `cnoe.md`
Featuring the [CNOE Open Source IDP](https://cnoe.io/) framework, which is built on open-source products and allows you to quickly scaffold a simple IDP.

### Demo 2: Pocket IDP with a Platform Orchestrator - `pocketidp.md`
This demo utilizes the [Humanitec Platform Orchestrator](https://humanitec.com) at its heart to scaffold a powerful, dynamic IDP.

#### What's a Platform Orchestrator?
According to Thoughtworks, Platform Orchestrators are:
>“A new generation of tools that go beyond the traditional platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model and offer published contracts between developers and platform teams. The contract might involve provisioning cloud environments, databases, monitoring, authentication and more in a different environment. These tools enforce organizational standards while granting developers self-service access to variations through configuration.”
